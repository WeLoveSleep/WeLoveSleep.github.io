<ol>
	<li><b> Stick to a limited color palette.</b> If all white isn’t for you, bring in your favorite colors, but in a thoughtful way. Here, the brights are limited to reds and oranges — which work beautifully with the brick wall and wooden furniture — and are teamed with plenty of white for an airy feel.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><b> Let the light in.</b> Keep window treatments to a minimum in a small space to make the most of the natural light and keep the look unfussy. For privacy add plain roller blinds or hang flat panels of lace or voile.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li><b> Maximize your storage space.</b> A floor-to-ceiling fitted unit makes the most of every inch in this bedroom. It cleverly incorporates room to display treasures, shelves for books, drawers for more personal items, surfaces that act as bedside tables and reading lights. Talk about multitasking!</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
	<li><b> Don’t be afraid to use windows.</b> There’s no rule that says you can’t push furniture up to a window. This bed is tucked neatly at the end of this small loft, rather than blocking the center of the room. Vertical blinds have been made to measure for privacy and to block daylight, and the window offers great reading light in the mornings.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
	<li><b> Trick the eye with mirrors.</b> Creating the illusion of space with mirrors is a classic trick that works every time. Perfect for smaller bedrooms, a mirrored wall will visually double the space. This one does the job in style, its high position keeping the effect subtle and the antiqued surface looking elegant.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
	<li><b> Have pieces made to measure.</b> Having custom furniture made for your space can be a very worthwhile investment. This twin bed has been designed to fit under the eaves perfectly, leaving plenty of space in the rest of the room. The built-in drawers and wall-mounted bedside table and light maximize every inch of floor, while a classic transparent chair provides unobtrusive seating.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">
	<li><b> Detract with a feature wall.</b> In a narrow room, bring the far wall forward with fabulous wallpaper. This pretty design links the pale blue walls and bronze quilt for a room that feels cohesive and has bags of personality.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">
	<li><b> Make your headboard work hard.</b> Using a headboard for storage is a clever way to make the most of your space. This custom solution manages to be a bedside table and bookcase as well as a headboard, and could easily be built to hold a rail and shelves on the opposite side for clothes.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="9">
	<li><b> Go for bold.</b> As the saying goes, “If you can’t fight, wear a big hat.” This attic bedroom shows off its sloping walls with pride and is consequently a bright, energetic space. A minimalist bed and desk area fit in neatly and make this teenager’s room a fun retreat.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="10">
	<li><b> Wow with white.</b> All white is a fail-safe space enhancer, but there are so many ways to do it. Here soft neutrals add just the right amount of warmth, while the minimal wall decorations draw the eye to the window and the view beyond. The neat built-in wall unit keeps clutter tucked out of sight behind slick drawer fronts, creating a serene mood.</li>
